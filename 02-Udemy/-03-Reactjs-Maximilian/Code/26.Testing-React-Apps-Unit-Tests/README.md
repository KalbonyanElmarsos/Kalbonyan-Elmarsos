# 😎Section Notes

## 😍Manual-texting VS automated-testing?

- 1. manual --> to test what will the end user will see, but its hard to test all possible combinations and scenarios.
- 2. automated --> code that tests your code, allowing to test all building blocks at once.

## 😍types o testing ?

- 1. unit-test--> test individual blocks(function,component) in isolation.
- 2. integration-test-> test a combination of blocks together.
- 3. end-to-end-test--> test a complete scenario in you app like user login.

## 😍jest-lib is the most used react testing-lib, it provided as a default when we install new react-app.
