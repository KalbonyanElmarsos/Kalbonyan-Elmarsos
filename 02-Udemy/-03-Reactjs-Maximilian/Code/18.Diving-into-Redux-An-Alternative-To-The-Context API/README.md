## 😍Redux--> a state management system.

## 😍ContextAPI has some drawBacks and disadvantages like--> 1) complex-setup, 2) bad performance in large complex apps

## 😍redux--> not allowed to mutate the state, but in redux/toolkit--> its allowed to mutate the state{note redux/toolkit not mutate the state as its internally/implicitly override it even if explicitly its seems that we mutate it}.
