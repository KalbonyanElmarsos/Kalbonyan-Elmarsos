# 😎Section Notes

## 😍React makes building complex,interactive and reactive UI more simpler in using declarative approach

## 😍React builds upon components--> it considers as a component-based(reusable UI in your app which a combination of js,html,css)

## 😍Why components?

- ✔for reusability.
- ✔for separation of concerns.

## 😍indexjs is the first file executed in react app.

## 😍in the Custom component, to render any jsx element inside it you need to use the props.children property

## 😍regular variables will not make rerendering for the component, its reevaluated and rerendered if and only if any dependent state changed

## 😍react hooks used only inside components and not allowed outside it or inside nested function inside the component(49)

## 😍any state must assign an initial value.

## 😍stateful component--> a component which has internal state

## 😍stateless component--> a component which has not any internal state it just a dump or representational component.
