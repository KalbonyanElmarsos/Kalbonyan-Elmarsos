# 😎Section Notes

## 😍Do not run async code in general in redux, no side effects in redux

## we can listen o any state generated by redux and make any side effects on this states like using use-effect if a specific state changed.

## 😍redux thunk--> a function that delays an action until later{an action creator function that does not return the action itself but another function which eventually return the action.}.

## 😍redux devTools as a chrome extension
