# üòéüòéSection Notes

## üßê01. Overview:

- üê±‚Äçüèçalgorithms==> a set of instructions to complete a specific task.

* Algorithm complexity:

  - space complexity ==> how much does it require to complete the task.
  - time complexity ==> how much time it require to complete the task.

  ## üßê02. Common data Structures:

  already taken in the last section

## üßê03. Recursion:

- when a function calls itself.
- rules:
  - a breaking condition to end the loop
  * each iteration the last args were saved.

## üßê04. Sorting Data:

- sort algorithms:

  - [bubble O(n2)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)
  - [merge 'divide and conquer' O(n log n)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/)
  - [quicksort 'divide and conquer' O(n log n)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/)

  ## üßê05. Other Algorithms:

- you can use the hash tables to find the unique values.

* you can use hash tables to count number of items occureing.
