# Programming Foundations: Algorithms
### Course details
- Algorithms are the universal building blocks of programming. They power the software you use every day, whether it's a spreadsheet, a social network, or a driving assistant. Algorithms offer a way to think about programming challenges in plain English, before they are translated into a specific language like C# or JavaScript. In this course, author and developer Joe Marini explains some of the most popular and useful algorithms for searching and sorting information, working with techniques like recursion, and understanding common data structures. He also discusses the performance implications of different algorithms and how to evaluate the performance of a given algorithm. Each algorithm is shown in practice in Python, but the lessons can be applied to any programming language.

# 😎😎Section Notes

## 🧐01. Overview:

- 🐱‍🏍algorithms==> a set of instructions to complete a specific task.

* 🐱‍🏍Algorithm complexity:

  - space complexity ==> how much does it require to complete the task.
  - time complexity ==> how much time it require to complete the task.

  ## 🧐02. Common data Structures:

  already taken in the last section

## 🧐03. Recursion:

- 🐱‍🏍when a function calls itself.
- 🐱‍🏍rules:
  - a breaking condition to end the loop
  * each iteration the last args were saved.

## 🧐04. Sorting Data:

- sort algorithms:

  - [bubble O(n2)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)
  - [merge 'divide and conquer' O(n log n)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/)
  - [quicksort 'divide and conquer' O(n log n)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/)

  ## 🧐05. Other Algorithms:

- 🐱‍🏍you can use the hash tables to find the unique values.

* 🐱‍🏍you can use hash tables to count number of items occureing.
